This proposal presents two works, States of Exception, an ongoing series of ink drawings, and Samira, an experimental video game.  Both works deal with disappearance.  A negative appearance as it relates to geometries of power. 

States of Exception is a reading, through a series of ink drawings, of the US Senate Intelligence Committee report on the CIA torture program that was declassified in December 2014. States of Exception explores the sites of torture as described in the report.  These “black sites” were meant not to exist, a point in zero dimensions residing outside of space and history.  For the detainees, however, this point becomes an entire universe and an eternity.  This point-universe describes a geometry of power, of the infinite reduced to zero, of zero becoming everything.  The geometry of power manifests itself most directly within the spaces of torture. These spaces, are built to be absent, forgotten, but they are nonetheless built. They remain. The power that wants to erase is nonetheless leaving artifacts. The detainees, forgotten, are in spaces that, in the stillness and extent of time, become all they can remember. 

States of Exception is a series of two-dimensional sections taken through the sites of torture.  The still, detailed instances document memories etched in an absent world.  The spaces remember bodies through their negative presence, molded by them though they have been erased.

Samira is an exprimental video game set within a 


Samira is an experimental video game that attempts at stretching the final moments of the life of the Egyptian poet and activist, Shayma’a al-Sabagh, as documented through a series of photographs.  Capturing the point of disappearance from the world, the photographs of al-Sabagh exist within the the world of memory.  Samira a two-dimensional section through the point of disappearance and the world of memory.  The character loops around a room, stuck within a single, repeating point unveils a story.
